## Overview

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by reversing a gradual noising process.

## Key Concepts

### Forward Process
- Gradually adds Gaussian noise to data
- Defined by a variance schedule

### Reverse Process
- Learns to denoise
- Trained using a denoising score matching objective

## Applications in Robotics

- Motion planning
- Trajectory generation
- Grasp pose generation
