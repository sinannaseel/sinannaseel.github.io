## About me

I am a researcher working on **robotic manipulation in confined spaces** using Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) for rearrangement of items. I am currently based at [Your University].

My research focuses on developing algorithms that enable robots to efficiently reorganize objects in cluttered, constrained environments.

## Research

My work focuses on confined space manipulation. Key areas include:

### Core Research Areas

- **Task and Motion Planning:** TAMP algorithms for complex rearrangement
- **Confined Space Manipulation:** Robots working in constrained environments
- **Rearrangement Strategies:** Sequential, non-monotonous approaches
- **Clutter Metrics:** Entropy-based measures

### Technical Focus

- Diffusion models for motion generation
- Reinforcement learning
- Convex and combinatorial optimization
- Sampling-based planning
- Probabilistic robotics
