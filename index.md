*Caption: Robot manipulating objects in confined space*

I am working on robotic manipulation in confined spaces using Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) for rearrangement of items.

## Current Research

### Task and Motion Planning for Rearrangement

![TAMP Diagram](/assets/images/research/tamp-diagram.png)

My research focuses on developing algorithms that enable robots to efficiently reorganize objects in cluttered, constrained environments.

Key areas:
- Optimization in confined spaces
- Entropy-based clutter measures
- Sequential rearrangement strategies
