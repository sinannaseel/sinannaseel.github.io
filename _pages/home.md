#### Hi, Naseel Here! 

I am a PhD student in Robotics with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), Manchester, UK. I am currently based at [RAICo1](https://raico.org/).

I have my MS in Robotics from the University of Manchester and my Btech in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Engineering.

**Naseel Sinan** and team (The University of Manchester) explore robotic solutions for the challenging post-operational clean-out of legacy nuclear gloveboxes at Sellafield. Our project focuses on designing a long, dexterous robotic system to safely investigate and remove hazardous materials from these confined spaces.
